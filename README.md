If you are going to run this bot for yourself have fun. We will provide no support.
You cant just download this bot and run it. It will NOT work.
Also the console doesnt log anything because it all goes to a discord text channel. check `config.example.js`!

Also dont forget to check out [the website](https://danbot.xyz) and make sure to join [the support server](https://discord.gg/yg9BRcu)
